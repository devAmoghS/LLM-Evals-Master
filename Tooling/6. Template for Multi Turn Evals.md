Building a comprehensive template for multi-turn evaluations involves creating a structured framework to assess the performance of a conversational AI system across multiple turns. Here's a detailed guide on how to build such a template, including verbose code and scripts suitable for production environments.

## Template Components for Multi-Turn Evaluations

1. **Conversation History**:
   - **Description**: The sequence of user inputs and system responses up to the current turn.
   - **Format**: List of text strings.

2. **Current Turn Input**:
   - **Description**: The user's input for the current turn.
   - **Format**: Text string.

3. **System Response**:
   - **Description**: The response generated by the system for the current turn.
   - **Format**: Text string.

4. **Reference Response**:
   - **Description**: The expected or correct response for the current turn.
   - **Format**: Text string.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Description**: Metrics used to evaluate the system's performance.
   - **Examples**: Factual Correctness, Faithfulness, Fluency, Contextual Relevance.

## Example Template Structure

Here's a basic template structure for multi-turn evaluations:

| **Conversation History** | **Current Turn Input** | **System Response** | **Reference Response** | **Evaluation Metrics** |
|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| ["Hello", "Hi"]          | "What is MLflow?"      | "MLflow is a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle." | "MLflow is a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle." | Factual Correctness: High, Faithfulness: High |

## Using Databricks and MLFlow for Evaluations

To integrate these evaluations with Databricks and MLFlow, you can leverage Databricks' managed MLFlow for tracking experiments and logging metrics.

### Example Python Code for Multi-Turn Evaluation with Databricks and MLFlow

To illustrate how to evaluate a multi-turn conversational AI system using Databricks and MLFlow, consider the following verbose example:

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
from nltk.metrics import f_measure
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Initialize MLFlow experiment
mlflow.set_experiment("MultiTurn_Evaluation")

# Prepare evaluation dataset
eval_data = pd.DataFrame({
    "conversation_history": [["Hello", "Hi"], ["Hello", "How are you?"], ["Hello", "What is MLflow?"], ["Hello", "What is Databricks?"], ["Hello", "What is MLFlow?", "MLflow is a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle."]],
    "current_turn_input": ["What is MLflow?", "What is Databricks?", "What is MLflow?", "What is Databricks?", "What is MLFlow?"],
    "system_response": ["MLflow is a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.", "Databricks is a cloud-based data engineering platform.", "MLflow is a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.", "Databricks is a cloud-based data engineering platform.", "MLflow is a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle."],
    "reference_response": ["MLflow is a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.", "Databricks is a cloud-based data engineering platform.", "MLflow is a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.", "Databricks is a cloud-based data engineering platform.", "MLflow is a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle."],
    "evaluation_metrics": [None, None, None, None, None]
})

# Define a function to evaluate multi-turn performance
def evaluate_multi_turn(eval_data):
    # Load model and tokenizer
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("your_model")
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your_model")
    
    # Evaluate each turn
    for index, row in eval_data.iterrows():
        conversation_history = row['conversation_history']
        current_turn_input = row['current_turn_input']
        system_response = row['system_response']
        reference_response = row['reference_response']
        
        # Calculate metrics such as factual correctness and faithfulness
        factual_correctness = calculate_factual_correctness(system_response, reference_response)
        faithfulness = calculate_faithfulness(system_response, conversation_history)
        fluency = calculate_fluency(system_response)
        contextual_relevance = calculate_contextual_relevance(system_response, conversation_history)
        
        # Log metrics with MLFlow
        with mlflow.start_run() as run:
            mlflow.log_metric("factual_correctness", factual_correctness)
            mlflow.log_metric("faithfulness", faithfulness)
            mlflow.log_metric("fluency", fluency)
            mlflow.log_metric("contextual_relevance", contextual_relevance)

# Evaluate multi-turn performance
evaluate_multi_turn(eval_data)

# Define functions to calculate specific metrics
def calculate_factual_correctness(system_response, reference_response):
    # Implement logic to calculate factual correctness
    pass

def calculate_faithfulness(system_response, conversation_history):
    # Implement logic to calculate faithfulness
    pass

def calculate_fluency(system_response):
    # Implement logic to calculate fluency
    pass

def calculate_contextual_relevance(system_response, conversation_history):
    # Implement logic to calculate contextual relevance
    pass
```

This code snippet demonstrates a comprehensive approach to evaluating a multi-turn conversational AI system using Databricks and MLFlow.

## Using Databricks for Scalable Evaluations

To scale your evaluations using Databricks, you can leverage its distributed computing capabilities to process large datasets efficiently. Here's a simplified example of how you might integrate this with Databricks:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MultiTurn_Evaluation").getOrCreate()

# Load evaluation dataset into Databricks
eval_df = spark.read.csv("evaluation_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Define a function to evaluate multi-turn performance on each row
def evaluate_multi_turn_row(row):
    # Extract relevant data
    conversation_history = row['conversation_history']
    current_turn_input = row['current_turn_input']
    system_response = row['system_response']
    reference_response = row['reference_response']
    
    # Calculate metrics such as factual correctness and faithfulness
    factual_correctness = calculate_factual_correctness(system_response, reference_response)
    faithfulness = calculate_faithfulness(system_response, conversation_history)
    fluency = calculate_fluency(system_response)
    contextual_relevance = calculate_contextual_relevance(system_response, conversation_history)
    
    return factual_correctness, faithfulness, fluency, contextual_relevance

# Apply the evaluation function to each row in the dataset
eval_results = eval_df.rdd.map(lambda row: evaluate_multi_turn_row(row)).collect()

# Print evaluation results
for result in eval_results:
    print(f"Factual Correctness: {result[0]}, Faithfulness: {result[1]}, Fluency: {result[2]}, Contextual Relevance: {result[3]}")
```

This example shows how to use Databricks to scale multi-turn evaluations across large datasets.

By integrating these components with Databricks and MLFlow, you can efficiently evaluate multi-turn conversational AI systems and track their performance across different experiments in a production-grade environment.
