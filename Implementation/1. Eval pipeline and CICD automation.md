Building an end-to-end evaluation pipeline with CI/CD automation for Large Language Models (LLMs) involves creating a comprehensive framework that integrates data preparation, model evaluation, and deployment using Databricks, MLFlow, and Python. Here's a detailed implementation guide:

## Step 1: Set Up Evaluation Pipeline

1. **Define Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Description**: Determine the metrics to evaluate LLM performance, such as accuracy, F1 score, and ROUGE score.
   - **Implementation**: Use MLFlow's `evaluate()` function to compute these metrics.

2. **Prepare Evaluation Data**:
   - **Description**: Collect and preprocess data for evaluation, including input queries and reference answers.
   - **Implementation**: Use Databricks to manage and preprocess large datasets efficiently.

3. **Implement Model Evaluation Logic**:
   - **Description**: Write Python scripts to evaluate LLMs using MLFlow's `evaluate()` function.
   - **Implementation**: Use the following example code:

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd

# Load evaluation dataset
eval_data = pd.DataFrame({
    "input_queries": ["What is MLflow?", "What is Databricks?"],
    "reference_answers": ["MLflow is a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.", "Databricks is a cloud-based data engineering platform."]
})

# Define a function to evaluate LLM performance
def evaluate_llm(eval_data):
    # Load LLM model
    model = "your_llm_model"
    
    # Evaluate LLM using MLFlow
    with mlflow.start_run() as run:
        results = mlflow.evaluate(
            model=model,
            data=eval_data,
            model_type="question-answering"
        )
        
        # Log evaluation results
        print(f"See aggregated evaluation results below: \n{results.metrics}")

# Evaluate LLM performance
evaluate_llm(eval_data)
```

## Step 2: Implement CI/CD Automation

1. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - **Description**: Use tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate the evaluation pipeline.
   - **Implementation**: Create a YAML file for GitHub Actions that runs the evaluation script on each code push.

2. **Integrate with Databricks**:
   - **Description**: Use the Databricks CLI to automate job execution and model deployment.
   - **Implementation**: Use the following example code in your CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
# Create a new job
databricks jobs create --new-cluster "evaluation_cluster" --python-file "path/to/evaluation_script.py"

# Run the job
databricks jobs run-now --job-id "job_id"
```

3. **Monitor and Deploy Models**:
   - **Description**: Use MLFlow's model registry to manage model versions and deploy them based on evaluation results.
   - **Implementation**: Use the following example code to deploy models:

```python
import mlflow

# Load model from MLFlow registry
model_name = "your_model_name"
model_version = "latest"

# Deploy model
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    mlflow.deployments.create(
        name="your_deployment_name",
        model_uri=f"models:/{model_name}/{model_version}",
        target="databricks"
    )
```

## Step 3: Implement Continuous Monitoring

1. **Set Up Monitoring Dashboard**:
   - **Description**: Use visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI to create a dashboard for monitoring model performance.
   - **Implementation**: Connect your dashboard to MLFlow's tracking server to display real-time metrics.

2. **Schedule Regular Evaluations**:
   - **Description**: Use the Databricks CLI to schedule regular evaluations of deployed models.
   - **Implementation**: Use cron jobs or Databricks' job scheduling feature to automate evaluations.

By integrating these components, you can create a comprehensive evaluation pipeline with CI/CD automation that ensures your LLMs are continuously evaluated and improved.

### Example Python Code for Full Pipeline

To illustrate the full pipeline, consider the following example that integrates data preparation, model evaluation, and deployment:

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("LLM_Evaluation").getOrCreate()

# Load evaluation dataset into Databricks
eval_df = spark.read.csv("evaluation_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Define a function to evaluate LLM performance
def evaluate_llm(eval_data):
    # Load LLM model
    model = "your_llm_model"
    
    # Evaluate LLM using MLFlow
    with mlflow.start_run() as run:
        results = mlflow.evaluate(
            model=model,
            data=eval_data.toPandas(),
            model_type="question-answering"
        )
        
        # Log evaluation results
        print(f"See aggregated evaluation results below: \n{results.metrics}")

# Evaluate LLM performance
evaluate_llm(eval_df)

# Deploy model based on evaluation results
if results.metrics["accuracy"] > 0.9:
    # Load model from MLFlow registry
    model_name = "your_model_name"
    model_version = "latest"
    
    # Deploy model
    with mlflow.start_run() as run:
        mlflow.deployments.create(
            name="your_deployment_name",
            model_uri=f"models:/{model_name}/{model_version}",
            target="databricks"
        )
```

This code snippet demonstrates a basic approach to integrating the evaluation pipeline with model deployment using MLFlow and Databricks.

By following these steps, you can create a robust and scalable evaluation pipeline with CI/CD automation for your LLMs.
