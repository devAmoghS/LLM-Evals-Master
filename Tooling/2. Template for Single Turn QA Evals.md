Here's a refined answer on building templates for single-turn QA evaluations using Databricks and MLFlow:

## Template Components for Single-Turn QA Evaluations

1. **Input Question**:
   - **Description**: The question to be answered by the model.
   - **Format**: Text string.

2. **Reference Answer**:
   - **Description**: The correct or expected answer to the question.
   - **Format**: Text string.

3. **Model Response**:
   - **Description**: The answer generated by the model.
   - **Format**: Text string.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Description**: Metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
   - **Examples**: Exact Match (EM), F1 Score, ROUGE Score.

5. **Context (Optional)**:
   - **Description**: Additional information that might be relevant for answering the question.
   - **Format**: Text string.

## Using Databricks and MLFlow for QA Evaluations

1. **MLFlow Integration**:
   - Use MLFlow to track experiments and log metrics. Databricks provides managed MLFlow for seamless integration.

2. **Databricks Agent Evaluation**:
   - Leverage Databricks' Agent Evaluation feature to assess QA models using built-in AI judges. This feature is available by specifying `model_type="databricks-agent"` in `mlflow.evaluate()`.

### Example Python Code for Single-Turn QA Evaluation with Databricks and MLFlow

To illustrate how to use Databricks and MLFlow for single-turn QA evaluations, consider the following example:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.types.llm import ChatCompletionResponse, ChatCompletionRequest

# Define an evaluation set
eval_set = [{
    "request": "What is the capital of France?",
    "expected_facts": ["Paris is the capital of France."],
    "guidelines": ["The response must be concise."]
}, {
    "request": "What is the weather today?",
    "guidelines": ["The response must reject the request."]
}]

# Define a simple QA model
def qa_model(messages):
    # Implement logic to generate responses
    if messages[0]["content"] == "What is the capital of France?":
        return "Paris"
    else:
        return "I don't know the weather today."

# Evaluate the QA model using Databricks Agent Evaluation
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    mlflow.evaluate(
        data=eval_set,
        model=lambda request: qa_model([{"role": "user", "content": request["request"]}]),
        model_type="databricks-agent"
    )
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use Databricks' Agent Evaluation with MLFlow to assess a QA model's performance.

### Using MLFlow for Tracking Experiments

To track experiments and log metrics, you can use MLFlow's `start_run()` and `log_metric()` functions:

```python
import mlflow

# Start a new experiment
mlflow.set_experiment("QA_Evaluation")

# Define a function to evaluate QA performance
def evaluate_qa(input_question, reference_answer):
    # Generate model response
    model_response = generate_model_response(input_question)
    
    # Calculate evaluation metrics
    exact_match = model_response == reference_answer
    f1_score = calculate_f1_score(model_response, reference_answer)
    
    return exact_match, f1_score

# Evaluate QA performance and log metrics
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    input_question = "What is the capital of France?"
    reference_answer = "Paris"
    exact_match, f1_score = evaluate_qa(input_question, reference_answer)
    
    mlflow.log_metric("exact_match", exact_match)
    mlflow.log_metric("f1_score", f1_score)
```

This example shows how to use MLFlow to track QA evaluation metrics.

By integrating these components with Databricks and MLFlow, you can efficiently evaluate single-turn QA models and track their performance across different experiments.
